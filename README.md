# Troubadour
*Your music, annotated your way.*
-------
A **personal database for musical analysis.** Like *Genius*, but without having to deal with other people's shitty misinterpretations of songs you like. Troubadour gives you a centralized location for organizing all your awesome annotations.

I made this because I love a lot of different music and I find it really satisfying to do my own analyses of my favorite songs. There's so much incredible lyricism out there, and I hope this project gives everyone the opportunity to be their own lyrical scholar. 

## Prospective features
If this gains some traction, maybe I'll add some more social features (sharing annotations, and such.). We could make it like a Letterboxd for lyrics. Anyone interested in collaborating on this project (and willing to deal with my terrifying SvelteKit ineptitude) is invited to contact me at **owner@jschere.com**.
